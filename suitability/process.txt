Upon adding a new data source:
 - Add a function to intake/lib.R to load it at the correct resolution (4320 x 720)
 - Create a script like the ones in intake/ to calculate the PDF and correlations (and run it
 to get the corresponding files)
 - Create a class like the ones in conditions
 - Add it to suitability and to future

1. Run suitability (once for each variety)
2. Run compare.R to get loess relationships (twice, swapping arabica with robusta after the specified line)
3. Run product
7. Run docs/display.R
4. Run docs/display-product.R (once for each variety)
4. Run future (once for each variety)
5. Run uncertainty (once for each variety)
8. Run docs/display-future.R (once for each variety)
6. Run bycountry (once for each variety)
